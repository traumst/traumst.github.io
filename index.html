            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <div>
                Greetings and salutations!
                I'm Alex, your humble host and software engineer with about
                <span class="since-2016"></span> years in the industry and still counting.
                This website is a reflection of me and my coding philosophy.
                No frills, no fuss - just plain, old-fashioned craftsmanship.
                After all, my heart truly lies in the realm of Command Line Interface,
                and this website is my concession to the GUI world.
            </div>
            <div>
                What's my approach, you ask?
                Simply put, it's all about keeping complexity demon in check.
                In our coding journey, we often cross the bridge from monolithic behemoth to microservices marvel.
                Along the way, we tangle with load balancers, databases, caches, and containers,
                not to mention the occasional graph database detour.
                Amidst all this, it's essential to keep a humble human perspective.
            </div>
            <div>
                By using design patterns(mention singleton once again and I swear I'm gonna snap),
                best practices, and some clever scoping, we can make code that's not just functional,
                but also future-proof and evolutionary.
                Sure, the allure of JS framework like Vue, a sprinkle of WASM components,
                or even a touch of Rust might tempt me down the line,
                but at the core, simplicity remains king.
            </div>
            <div>
                Let's delve a bit into my backstory.
                From the lively Petah Tikva to the vibrant tech scene,
                I've been on a <span class="since-2016"></span> year-long roller coaster ride in software engineering.
                Although my journey started at Bar Ilan University in Computer Engineering,
                the spirit of the startup world lured me away from it.
            </div>
            <div>
                I've worked on a cybersecurity venture, wrapping websites in the cozy blanket of security,
                and have since dabbled in multiple other startups.
                You can find details of those on the <a href="#about">About</a> section.
                This rollercoaster ride has given me a colorful palette of backend languages and technologies,
                from JavaScript and C# to Rust and PHP, Python, SQL, Shell Scripting and even LUA if you can believe it.
            </div>
            <div>
                As a backend enthusiast, I've danced with the likes of nginx, redis, kafka/rabbitmq, and docker.
                Although I started out working with plain JavaScript,
                I've since been swept up in the wave of modern JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Vue.
                However, the charm of Rust and the allure of Yew still hold a special place in my heart.
            </div>
            <div>
                Over the years, I've tangled with design patterns, wrangled with code refactoring, and dabbled in DB operations.
                If there's one thing I've learned, it's that 'good' code is not just about functioning flawlessly today.
                It's about standing the test of time and enabling easy refactoring and transitions between architectural styles.
            </div>
            <div>
                Throughout this journey,
                I've learned that software engineering is as much about
                simplifying ideas and spreading knowledge as it is about coding.
                I thrive in smaller teams where I can lead by example, foster open dialogues,
                and promote continuous learning.
            </div>
            <div>
                Welcome to my world - a place where we keep it simple, keep it human, and always, always keep learning.

                    Leaving the UX/UI benefits aside, what I personally am involved in is providing the best

                    We coagulate disperse information relevant to a physician for a given patient.
                    No more clicking on a million arbitrary tabs of the outdated system, everything they need
                    should just be right there, concisely presented in a single place with appropriate context

                    Tipalti is an Account Payable Automation Software, that optimizes expenditures and report of that.
                    I was a part of the payments team, which means we delt with anything related to the movement of money.
                    From determining the best route to ensuring every monetary operation was done proptly and without fail,
                    our entire team focus was on doing this "by the book".
                    Operating under money-transmitter license, the firm had to make sure to settle any and all pending transactions
                    by the end of the day, leaving no funds in mid-air.
                    We wrote tests and peer-reviewed each others code changes to ensure best delivery with minimal potential for bugs.
                    Since the company was already established, I did not have to setup any infrastructure and only interacted with it as a user.

                    Entity Framework for the DB interaction, and many other tools, all of which were provided as libraries.
                    No client side changes were made by me here, except for some internal tooling.

                    As a B2B sociam media management platform, Oktopost takes up on a challenge of providing
                    a hub for all of your company's social media needs.
                    We enabled companies to run marketing campaigns, aggregated and presented elaborate engagement statistics
                    and allowed for clean, yet sophisticated way of communication with the consumers.
                    Targeting to improve impact of social networks on the business.
                    Most of the infrastructure was setup and maintained in-house by a small and dedicated team,
                    be it CI/CD pipelines or DevOps.
                    I was part of a small server team, built microservices in donet and maintained and
                    augmented existing product written almost entirely in php.

                    I joined Cognni in early 2018, back then it was called Shiledox and was sort of
                    a cybersecurity startup, that wanted <i>shield</i> enterprise client documents in
                    a seamless manner.
                    We later pivoted to pure analytics tool, focused on AI-based classification and data analysis.
                    We built a distributed cloud system for data analysis, integrated proprietary classification
                    and we did that to make the job of CISO easier, presenting potential data leaks and
                    security anomalies in a sleek and concise way.
                    All of this analysis ran in semi-realtime to provide the best intelligence on the
                    movement of data inside of organizations and limit exposure of sensitive info to the outside world.

                <p>
                    I've joined ChameleonX in it's ealriest stage and was in fact their first employee.
                    We developed an integrity layer for the website which ensure site is displayed the way it was intended.
                    We used this tech to serve ads through the adblockers, but later pivoted to the cybersecurity angle.
                    When I joined there was a POC written in older .Net framework version of C# that was
                    intended to be used as Wordpress plugin.
                    There I delved into the depth of software design and learned about quite literally everything.
                    Layers of the internet, protocols, CDNs, proxies, reverse-proxies, code-injection, load balancing and much much more.
                    We've developed and grown a monolith up from scratch, deployed it manually to cloud VMs,
                    only ever taking a short breather for some vanila JS scripting. Not even a JQuery.
                    Oh, and did I mention LUA scripting for regex-based proxy pass-through code injections?
                    Yeah I did that. Complemented with custom nginx builds for both injections I mentioned
                    as well as load balancing.
                    Those were the days.

                    .Net Framework - probably 3.5 or something like that, Sql Server, and endless cloud related resources.
                    We didn't really have a front end, as our scripts would be injected into existing websites,
                    so we couldn't use any libraries or risk breaking client website.
