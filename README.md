# Personal website

Nothing much here, I just thought it'd be cool to have a website.
It's just plain old HTML+CSS+JS with a little something extra, see if you can find it.
I've done react and vue, meddled with lodash and used jquery, so here I've decided to go back to basics to see how things improved.
And boy did they improve.

All backgrounds are SVGs which are drawn by JS in real-time.
This website can be accessed at https://alextech.pro as well as https://traumst.github.io, with the only difference being email form will not work on the latter.
