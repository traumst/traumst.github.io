<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<div>
    Greetings and salutations!
    I'm Alex, your humble host and software engineer with about
    <span class="since-2016"></span> years in the industry and still counting.
    This website is a reflection of me and my coding philosophy.
    No frills, no fuss - just plain, old-fashioned craftsmanship.
    After all, my heart truly lies in the realm of Command Line Interface,
    and this website is my concession to the GUI world.

    What's my approach, you ask?
    Simply put, it's all about keeping complexity demon in check.
    In our coding journey, we often cross the bridge from monolithic behemoth to microservices marvel.
    Along the way, we tangle with load balancers, databases, caches, and containers,
    not to mention the occasional graph database detour.
    Amidst all this, it's essential to keep a humble human perspective.

<div>
    By using design patterns(mention singleton once again and I swear I'm gonna snap),
    best practices, and some clever scoping, we can make code that's not just functional,
    but also future-proof and evolutionary.
    Sure, the allure of JS framework like Vue, a sprinkle of WASM components,
    or even a touch of Rust might tempt me down the line,
    but at the core, simplicity remains king.

    Let's delve a bit into my backstory.
    From the lively Petah Tikva to the vibrant tech scene,
    I've been on a <span class="since-2016"></span> year-long roller coaster ride in software engineering.
    Although my journey started at Bar Ilan University in Computer Engineering,
    the spirit of the startup world lured me away from it.

<div>
    I've worked on a cybersecurity venture, wrapping websites in the cozy blanket of security,
    and have since dabbled in multiple other startups.
    You can find details of those on the <a href="#about">About</a> section.
    This rollercoaster ride has given me a colorful palette of backend languages and technologies,
    from JavaScript and C# to Rust and PHP, Python, SQL, Shell Scripting and even LUA if you can believe it.
</div>
<div>
    As a backend enthusiast, I've danced with the likes of nginx, redis, kafka/rabbitmq, and docker.
    Although I started out working with plain JavaScript,
    I've since been swept up in the wave of modern JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Vue.
    However, the charm of Rust and the allure of Yew still hold a special place in my heart.
</div>
<div>
    Over the years, I've tangled with design patterns, wrangled with code refactoring, and dabbled in DB operations.
    If there's one thing I've learned, it's that 'good' code is not just about functioning flawlessly today.
    It's about standing the test of time and enabling easy refactoring and transitions between architectural styles.
</div>
<div>
    Throughout this journey,
    I've learned that software engineering is as much about
    simplifying ideas and spreading knowledge as it is about coding.
    I thrive in smaller teams where I can lead by example, foster open dialogues,
    and promote continuous learning.

<div>
    Welcome to my world - a place where we keep it simple, keep it human, and always, always keep learning.
