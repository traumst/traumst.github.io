    <p>This website</p><br/>
    <p>
        First is, obviously, this very website. Yeah, pretty cool. All that html+css is simply beautiful.
        No need to compile it or anything. Can just run it locally or, like moi, serve it from an nginx.
        You know. It's simple. I did play around and made every section load dynamically with a little
        HTMX magic. But otherwise - plain and simple.

        Here's the <a href="https://github.com/traumst/traumst.github.io" target="_blank">reference to the repo</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i><u>Did you know?</u></i>
            Github provides a static server for when your repo is named like <pre>{USER_NAME}.github.io</pre>.
            Which makes this repo available at <a href="https://traumst.github.io">traumst.github.io</a> without a dedicated backend.

    <p>The backend</p><br />
    <p>
        Second, there's the backend. It is written in Rust at the moment.
        Why Rust? Well, why not? I mean I could write it in C and it would take as much time.
        I guess I just prefer to... suffer in a... modern way. Yes, that's it.
        To hell with seg faults! All hail the borrow checker!
        But seriously, I know many languages. Rust is different. It makes me think different.
        Which in turn makes me see new depths in programming. Isn't that good enough of a reason?
    </p>
    <p>
        You can find the <a href="https://github.com/traumst/traumst-api" target="_blank">repo for the backend here</a>.

    <p>
        Oh, and this repo also contains the Dockerfile as well as some other automation-related stuff.

    <p>Chat</p>
    <br />
    <p>
        Next up, I wanted to make something that would require a little more creativity.
        So I settled for a chat app. Why? Well, it requires a db, concurrency and some net-code.
        Until now I managed to avoid websockets, so there's sse instead.
        Gotta try and stuff gRPC/protbuff in there somewhere as well, just for lulz.
        This is "the meat" so to speak.

        <a href="https://github.com/traumst/min-chat" target="_blank">Here's the link to its repo,</a>
        it's opensource now, I may even deploy it soon.
        "Just few more features"
