        and helpful suggestions of what next steps to take.

    <h3>Tipalti - between 2022 and 2023</h3>
    <p>
        Tipalti is an Account Payable Automation Software, that optimizes expenditures and report of that.
        I was a part of the payments team, which means we delt with anything related to the movement of money.
        From determining the best route to ensuring every monetary operation was done proptly and without fail,
        our entire team focus was on doing this "by the book".
        Operating under money-transmitter license, the firm had to make sure to settle any and all pending transactions
        by the end of the day, leaving no funds in mid-air.
        We wrote tests and peer-reviewed each others code changes to ensure best delivery with minimal potential for
        bugs.
        Since the company was already established, I did not have to setup any infrastructure and only interacted with
        it as a user.
    </p>

    <p>
        Stack:
        .Net 5 microservices in conjunction with legacy .Net 4.5 monolith, running in AWS ec2 and lambdas.
        Entity Framework for the DB interaction, and many other tools, all of which were provided as libraries.
        No client side changes were made by me here, except for some internal tooling.

    <p>
        As a B2B sociam media management platform, Oktopost takes up on a challenge of providing

        and allowed for clean, yet sophisticated way of communication with the consumers.
        Targeting to improve impact of social networks on the business.
        Most of the infrastructure was setup and maintained in-house by a small and dedicated team,
        be it CI/CD pipelines or DevOps.
        I was part of a small server team, built microservices in donet and maintained and
        augmented existing product written almost entirely in php.

    <h3>Cognni - from 2018 to 2021</h3>
    <p>
        I joined Cognni in early 2018, back then it was called Shiledox and was sort of
        a cybersecurity startup, that wanted <i>shield</i> enterprise client documents in
        a seamless manner.
        We later pivoted to pure analytics tool, focused on AI-based classification and data analysis.
        We built a distributed cloud system for data analysis, integrated proprietary classification
        and we did that to make the job of CISO easier, presenting potential data leaks and
        security anomalies in a sleek and concise way.
        All of this analysis ran in semi-realtime to provide the best intelligence on the
        movement of data inside of organizations and limit exposure of sensitive info to the outside world.

        Stack:
        .Net 5 and NodeJS microservices, based on vms running in Azure.
        Managed MySQL service, ServiceBus - managed queue service and other services for caching and CI/CD.
        VueJS on the frontend, which I was involved in limited capacity, mostly solving CORS-issues.

    <h3>ChameleonX - from 2016 to 2017</h3>
    <p>
        I've joined ChameleonX in it's ealriest stage and was in fact their first employee.
        We developed an integrity layer for the website which ensure site is displayed the way it was intended.
        We used this tech to serve ads through the adblockers, but later pivoted to the cybersecurity angle.
        When I joined there was a POC written in older .Net framework version of C# that was
        intended to be used as Wordpress plugin.
        There I delved into the depth of software design and learned about quite literally everything.
        Layers of the internet, protocols, CDNs, proxies, reverse-proxies, code-injection, load balancing and much much
        more.
        We've developed and grown a monolith up from scratch, deployed it manually to cloud VMs,
        only ever taking a short breather for some vanila JS scripting. Not even a JQuery.
        Oh, and did I mention LUA scripting for regex-based proxy pass-through code injections?
        Yeah I did that. Complemented with custom nginx builds for both injections I mentioned
        as well as load balancing.
        Those were the days.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
        Stack:
        .Net Framework - probably 3.5 or something like that, Sql Server, and endless cloud related resources.
        We didn't really have a front end, as our scripts would be injected into existing websites,
        so we couldn't use any libraries or risk breaking client website.
